### Introduction
This is a virtual Engima machine which replicates the original 3-rotor military-grade Engima device
used by the Kriegsmarine during the Second World War. The Enigma was a carefully designed and extremely advanced encryption device (for the day) that not only mapped characters through multiple layers,
but also guaranteed that identical, consecutive characters would not show up as the same letter by use of a rotating
rotor wheel, frustrating the efforts to apply linguistic measures. This results in about 150 trillion different possible mappings, making decrypting these messages by hand
virtually impossible. Enigma was eventually decrypted through social engineering tactics, linguistic pattern recognition,
and through the use of computers, though Engima itself also evolved over time to frustrate decrypting efforts.

### Operator Specifications
The operation of the machine is as follows:  
To encrypt a message, first reset the rotors. Then set the rotors to the agreed position. Next, choose the correct plugboard mapping. Now, the operator
may type in the plaintext message, letter by letter. The ciphertext will show up on the lamp panel, letter by letter.
Note that the rotors should not be manually adjusted after the initial position set.  
  
To decrypt a message and determine the plaintext contents, follow the same procedure that encrypts the message, only, the operator should enter the ciphertext instead of the plaintext.

Note, the reset button only restores the configuration of the rotors, not the plugboard. To restore the plugboard, the machine must be closed
and reopened.

### Design Specifications  
The 3 rotors and the reflector are exact replicas of the original Rotor I, Rotor II, Rotor III, and reflector used by the Kriegsmarine early in the Second World War.
Although later designs changed the rotor layout and introduced more rotors, this project is only meant to demonstrate the original.
